# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

| Previous surface | Current surface |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `agentscan popup` for human pane picking | `agentscan tui` |
| TUI-shaped stdout parsing | `agentscan list --format json` |
| Raw cache/envelope inspection through `agentscan cache` | `agentscan snapshot --format json` |
| Cache file IPC and `AGENTSCAN_CACHE_PATH` | Daemon socket snapshots |
| Implicit direct tmux reads in normal consumers | Daemon-backed reads with explicit `scan` or `--refresh` recovery |

- Normal `agentscan`, `list`, `inspect`, `focus`, `snapshot`, and `tui` flows
  now read daemon socket state by default.
- Normal consumers auto-start the daemon. Use `--no-auto-start` or
  `AGENTSCAN_NO_AUTO_START=1` when a script or CI job must not spawn a daemon;
  opt-out failures do not fall back to direct tmux reads.
- `agentscan scan` remains daemon-free and always reads tmux directly.
- Supported `--refresh` flags remain the direct tmux bypass for one-shot
  recovery and debugging.
- `agentscan tui` is interactive-only and subscribes to live daemon socket
  snapshots. It has no cache bootstrap, no direct tmux discovery fallback, and
  no machine-readable `--format` mode. Pane selection still uses the normal tmux
  focus behavior.
- The `agentscan cache` command family is removed, including `cache path` and
  `cache validate`.
- The persisted cache file is not a supported IPC boundary. Snapshot JSON may
  still include compatibility vocabulary such as `diagnostics.cache_origin`;
  that field does not indicate an active cache transport.
- There is no cache-file IPC replacement. Socket-isolated tests and harnesses
  should use `AGENTSCAN_SOCKET_PATH` when they need a non-default daemon socket.

### Operator Notes

- Use `agentscan list --format json` for normal automation.
- Use `agentscan list --all --format json` when automation intentionally needs
  non-agent panes.
- Use `agentscan snapshot --format json` only for raw `SnapshotEnvelope`
  consumers.
- Keep tmux key bindings and other human-facing launch paths on
  `agentscan tui`.
- Tmux `display-popup` remains a valid way to launch the binary inside tmux;
  it is separate from the removed `agentscan popup` command.
